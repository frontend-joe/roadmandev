    Now stealing in a digital context is very different to as I put it - the looting that took place all across the UK in 2012. In a digital world you have copying and you have stealing. Copying is when you straight up rinse someones work and pass it off as your own. You might do this in college or univesity and get away with it, but it not something you wanna bring into you dev career.
